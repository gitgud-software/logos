      lo/g/OS => Something that /g/ will hate no matter what I do.
</sup>
<br>
</p>

**Why are you forking lo/g/os?**
* The current development team has decided to prioritize rolling out riceDB first.
* Openbox seems like a viable alternative to i3 that deserves a bit of exploration before it is tossed out as an option.
* A lot of /g/-made software simply isn't included in the main setup. If this is a /g/ operating system, we could include /g/ software.
* Yes, whatever, it's bloat. If you want to adhere to the Arch Way, just install Arch.
* Not enough Tidus.

**Planned Additions (Proposed)**
* Openbox (over i3)
* nano
* /g/fortune
* Transmission
* Tox (some version, probably qTox client)
* The femSF suite (C+=)
* LOLCODE
* bropages
* Privilege Checker
